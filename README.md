# MPI
Here I will list the following exercises that I implemented on my PDA laboratory
Ex1- Write a program that prints all the prime numbers less than N using M processes.
Ex2- Write a program that searches an element inside an array and prints its position in case the array contains that element, otherwise it prints 'Not found.'
Ex3- Let there be n processes. Each process generates m (m>=100) random numbers ( <=1000 ), prints them to the console, computes their sum and prints it to the console. Determine      the time it takes for each process to complete the job.

Ex5-
